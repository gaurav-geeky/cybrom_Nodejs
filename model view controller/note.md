express Router is used to do routing 

# controller file

but  with controllers  we can do it for multiple pages 
in ___ controller ___ there no need to  import express  only page function of  different pages as we do using   req, res .  
at last export all 


# routes file
IMPORt that functions in route folder then  use that function in Route.get("/home", controller.home )
export it also   

# index file 
export things from  router. 
do the same this as we did in  Router
